5. Create a python file named Rectangle, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given Rectangle

        Hint: width and length need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of rectangle
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    length = 5
                    width = 2

                output:
                    Area of the rectangle is equal to 10
                    Perimeter of rectangle is equal to 14
"""
length = 5
width = 2

# Calculate the area and perimeter of the square
area = length * width
perimeter = (length + width)*2

print("Area of the rectangle is equal to", area)
print("Perimeter of the rectangle is equal to", perimeter)
